// Write a function that returns the factorial of a number.
// As a quick refresher, a factorial of a number is the result of that number multiplied by
// the number before it,and the number before that number, and so on, until you reach 1.
// The factorial of 1 is just 1.

const factorial = (num) => {
    if (num === 1) return 1;
    return num * factorial(num-1);
